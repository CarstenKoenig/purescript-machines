# PureScript-Machines

This library helps you build finite state machines. Currently, there's an implementation for mealy machines with halting.

**Note**: If you need the ability to produce errors, consume from multiple input tapes, or guarantee resource cleanup, you should probably be using [PureScript Streams](http://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-streams) instead.

## Installation

This can be installed with Bower:

```shell
bower i purescript-machines
```

## Documentation

API docs can be found [here](docs/Data/Machine/Mealy.md).
